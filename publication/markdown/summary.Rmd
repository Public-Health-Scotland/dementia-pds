# Dementia Post-Diagnostic Support
## NHS Board Performance to `r max(pds$fy)`
#### A Management Information publication for Scotland

#### Publication date: `r format(pub_date, "%d %B %Y")`
##### RESTRICTED STATISTICS: embargoed to 09:30 `r format(pub_date, "%d/%m/%Y")`

### About this release

This release by Information Services Division (ISD) reports on NHS Board performance against the Scottish Government’s Local Delivery Plan (LDP) standard that all those newly diagnosed with dementia should have a minimum of twelve months post-diagnostic support. Performance against the LDP standard is reported in two parts. The percentage of people referred for post diagnostic support who received a minimum of one year’s support, and the percentage of people estimated to be newly diagnosed with dementia who were referred for post-diagnostic support.

Figures reported in this release are for `r glue_collapse(fy_in_pub, sep = ", ", last = " and ")`. They are published as management information because **??**.


### Main Points

* There were `r referrals %>% filter(fy == fy_in_pub[1]) %>% pull(referrals)` people referred for dementia post-diagnostic support in `r fy_in_pub[1]` and `r referrals %>% filter(fy == fy_in_pub[2]) %>% pull(referrals)` in `r fy_in_pub[2]`.

* Of those referred to dementia post-diagnostic support in `r fy_in_pub[1]`, `r ldp12 %>% filter(fy == fy_in_pub[1]) %>% pull(perc)` received one year of support as proposed in the LDP standard, and `r ldp12 %>% filter(fy == fy_in_pub[2]) %>% pull(perc)` in `r fy_in_pub[2]`.

* In `r fy_in_pub[2]`, those aged `r max_age$age_grp` years accounted for the largest percentage of people referred to dementia post-diagnostic support services (`r max_age$perc`).

![Alt Text](figures/summary-figure.png) <br>

* In `r fy_in_pub[2]`, `r sum(ldp12_ijb$inc)` of the 31 Integration Joint Boards had the same or a higher percentage of people referred and receiving 12 months support compared to `r fy_in_pub[1]`.

* It is estimated that `r ldp_exp %>% filter(fy == fy_in_pub[2]) %>% pull(perc)` of people estimated to be newly diagnosed with dementia within `r fy_in_pub[2]` were referred for PDS.


### Background

In 2010’s ‘Scotland’s National Dementia Strategy’, the Scottish Government made a commitment to improving post-diagnostic support for individuals receiving a diagnosis of dementia. The Scottish Government endorsed a 12 month post-diagnosis support model that used [The Five Pillars](http://www.alzscot.org/campaigning/five_pillars) methodology developed by Alzheimer Scotland, and concluded with a person-centred support plan. The Scottish Government published their [third national dementia strategy](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-national-dementia-strategy-2017-2020/) in 2017 which continues to support the post-diagnostic support entitlement.

In order to effectively monitor performance of post-diagnosis support delivery, a national [Local Delivery Plan (LDP) standard](https://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/NHSScotlandperformance/Dementia-LDP) was introduced in April 2013 for all those newly diagnosed with dementia to receive a minimum of one year’s post-diagnostic support.

NHS Boards provide quarterly data submissions to ISD containing information on individuals referred for post-diagnostic support within their local services and this dataset forms the basis of the LDP standard calculation. Revised data definitions and reporting processes were effective from 1 April 2019 and have improved the data quality and consistency of post-diagnostic support information. The Scotland level error rate for `r glue_collapse(fy_in_pub, sep = ", ", last = " and ")` is `r err %>% summarise(err_perc = round_half_up(sum(total_errors) / sum(records) * 100, 0)) %>% pull(err_perc)`%. Due to the change in definitions information presented in this publication is not comparable to previously published information relating to the Dementia Post Diagnostic Support LDP standard.

This report presents final figures for `r fy_in_pub[1]` and provisional figures for `r fy_in_pub[2]` which will be revised in the next publication.

The second part of the LDP standard requires the number of referrals to be compared against an estimated number of newly diagnosed dementia cases each year. Estimates of dementia incidence are from the Scottish Government paper [‘Estimated and Projected Diagnosis Rates for Dementia in Scotland 2014-2020’](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/12/9363) published in 2016.
