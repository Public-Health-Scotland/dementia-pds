# Introduction

This release by Information Services Division (ISD) reports on the Scottish Government’s Local Delivery Plan (LDP) standard that all those newly diagnosed with dementia should have a minimum of one year’s post-diagnostic support. Data are presented by financial year of diagnosis and this report presents finalised figures for 2016/17 and provisional figures for 2017/18 which are subject to some service users completing their support.

The Scottish Government published their [third national dementia strategy](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-national-dementia-strategy-2017-2020/) in 2017. This included the commitment to extend and embed dementia post-diagnostic support. In order to effectively monitor the delivery of post-diagnostic support a national [local delivery plan (LDP) standard](https://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/NHSScotlandperformance/Dementia-LDP) was introduced for all those newly diagnosed with dementia to receive a minimum of one year’s post-diagnostic support. 

The LDP standard is reported in two parts, each addressing a separate element to the standard:

1.	The percentage of people estimated to be newly diagnosed with dementia who were referred for post-diagnostic support.
2.	The percentage of people referred for dementia post-diagnostic support who received a minimum of one year’s support.

NHS Boards provide quarterly data submissions to ISD on individuals diagnosed and referred for post-diagnostic support within their local areas and this dataset forms the basis of the LDP standard calculation. 

<br>

## Comparability to previously published LDP standard figures
Revised [data definitions](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Mental-Health/Dementia-Post-diagnostic-Support/_docs/Dementia-PDS-Definitions-and-Recording-Guidance.pdf) and reporting processes were effective from 1 April 2019 for all dementia diagnoses and referrals for post-diagnostic support from 1 April 2016 onwards. The revised definitions were designed in consultation with stakeholders to improve the quality and consistency of the data reported. 

Due to the change in definitions, improvements in data quality and refinements to the method used to calculate the LDP standard, information presented in this publication is not comparable to previously published information relating to the dementia post-diagnostic support LDP standard.

The Scotland level error rate for both 2016/17 and 2017/18 is around 3%. Further information around data quality can be found in [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---background-information).
